mood is deferred until the pupil urcy be expected to be thorougbly
at honre in bis use of the active aud the indicative.

Conditioual sentences have been admitted only iu their plaiucst
forms, arrd have been treated, not with a view to cxlrausting the

werden ; '’ aud we have tried to avoid falling iuto the condemnatiou
receutly expressed by an eminent American educational authority
in the following words: “The ordinary text-book is still found, as
years age, to presuppose deadness or incompeteuce ou the instruc-
tor’s part; stuffcd with matter not only useless but iu the way.''
