Iu the preparation of this book the authors have aimed to
present the essentiale, aud only the essentials‚ of Latin Grammar
in a clear and simple form. They have thought that most rirst
Latin Books attempted too much, aod by a multiplicity of details
obscured the simple elements of vgrarnrnatical structure. Itis not
necessary, it is not possible, to teach the whole Latin Grannum· in
oue year3 and the pupil’s further progress is rather biudered thau
helped by burdeuing his memory and confusing his judgment with
etymologica] technicalities and' syntectical subtletics. Especially
is this true of the first few lessous, and these have been made as
easy as possible, in the belief that time is saved by slow progress
at the beginning. lf the pupil ieels that heis being carried on in
spite of himself through things of which he has uo clear concep-
tion, discoucagement, confusion, aud failure are the almost inevi-
table results. He should feel that be is driving and not being
driven by his work.

The Lessons are so arranged that each one is complete in itself,
and noue is so long as to require that it be divided. ln each
Lessou the forms to be learned are placed first, und followed by
the model sentence, which illustratas and emphasizes the principle
involved. Then come Latin sentences illustrating the use of tha
forms and the syntax, followed hythe rulo, which isan induction
from the sentences, aod English sentences that afford practica in
the application of the rule. The vocabulary is placed at the end,
and should be learned after the other work of the lesson is done.

lu addition to these general statements we may be allowed to
call attention to the following:

The vocabularies are in all cases extremely short, and it is
expected that they will bc thoroughly learned.
